29 Dec: Guided implementation of Tic Tac Toe in React + vanilla JS following a React tutorial at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

30 Dec: My own conversion of Tic Tac Toe into React + TypeScript plus refactoring for code maintainability.

31 Dec: Guided implementation of blog with Rails + SQLite3, following a Rails tutorial at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

10 Jan: Still unable to get the Delete part of my Rails 7 CRUD blog to work. I am unable to debug it myself as I do not innately understand the workings of routes, APIs, etc., which makes me uncomfortable. I do not like using things I dont understand blindly.
Additionally, I will have an easier time learning Golang as I have experience in Python and C. Hence, I have decided to switch to Golang instead. I am currently learning the basics of Golang in my repository.
